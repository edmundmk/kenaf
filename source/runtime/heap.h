/*
    A memory allocator with the following interface:

      - New blocks can be allocated.
      - A heap walker can walk through each block, optionally freeing blocks.
      - Each allocated block has a 4-byte header just before it.

    Based on Doug Lea's dlmalloc.  http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/dl/html/malloc.html

    The allocator is not synchronized internally.  Access from multiple threads
    must be synchronized by the user.
