    GC happens like this:

        COLLECTOR                                   MUTATOR
                            -- orange epoch --
                                                    allocates orange objects
                                                    mutates references freely
                            -- safepoint --         reaches safepoint

        grab mutator's marks                        old orange values are marked
        done marking                                eager mark cothreads
                            -- safepoint --         reaches safepoint
                            sweep orange keys
                            sweep orange layouts
                            -- orange is dead --
        sweep heap                                  all objects should be purple.
                            -- purple epoch --

    There are two colours, orange and purple.  At any point, the mutator:

      - Allocates objects as either orange or purple.
      - Marks old values which are either orange, purple, or neither.

    Marking and sweeping happens concurrently.  There are several operations
    that require synchronization.

    When GC is initiated:

      - The GC thread isn't doing anything except waiting to be triggered.
      - Marking of roots and active cothread stacks happens before resuming.

    During the mark phase:

      - The GC thread and the mutator thread have separate mark stacks.
      - When writing references, or when pushing a cothread, the mutator
        marks previously reachable objects that are unmarked.
      - When the GC thread runs out of work, it steals the mutator thread's
        mark stack.
      - When the GC thread steals an empty stack, marking is done.

    During the sweep phase:

      - The mutator must lock before allocating objects.
      - The GC thread must lock during sweeping.

    The mutator thread has a countdown of how many bytes its allowed to
    allocate from the heap before triggering a GC.  If this limit is exhausted,
    a GC is triggered at the next safepoint.
