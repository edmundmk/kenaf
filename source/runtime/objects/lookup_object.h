/*
    This is the object model for the VM.  Objects support lookup using keys.
    Keys are strings which have been interned in the key map.

    Each object has a reference to a layout object (a 'hidden class').  A
    layout object associates a key with a particular slot index.  Each layout
    object is at the end of a linked list of layout objects.  Taken as a whole,
    this list associates keys with all slots in an object.

    Normally keys are added in the same order to objects with the same
    prototype.  There is a link from each layout to it successor layout.
    However, if keys are added in different orders to different objects, then
    there is a split in the layout chain.  These are stored in the vm's split
    map.

    Currently when we lookup a key on an object we follow the entire layout
    chain in order.  We rely on selectors to accelerate lookup.

    When an object is used as a prototype it is sealed.  This means that its
    layout becomes fixed, and we can accelerate lookups further by caching a
    pointer to its slots directly.  Objects that inherit from a prototype
    object begin life with an empty layout that is the root of the chain for
    this object.  The link between a prototype object and the root of its
    layout chain is stored in the vm's proto map.

    Lookups are performed using a selector.  A selector caches the result of
    lookup so that subsequent lookups with the same selector on the same
    layout can reuse the result.
