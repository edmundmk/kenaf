/*
    The folding process performs the following transformations:

      - Expressions involving only constants are precomputed.
      - Conditional branches based on constant values are made unconditional.

      - Unreachable blocks are removed.
      - Instructions are marked if their value is used.
      - Unused instructions are removed.

      - Constants are inlined into instructions that allow constant operands.
      - Constants and selectors are allocated space in the function's tables.
